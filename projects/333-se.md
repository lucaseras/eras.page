During my senior year at Wesleyan University, I had the amazing privilege to
help create an entire course for the computer science department. Working with
Professor [Sebastian Zimmeck](https://sebastianzimmeck.de), I created various
tutorials for students, including: how to use the Unix shell, how to program in
JavaScript, and how to create a simple mobile app using React Native. I also
helped with the creation of homework assignments, proposing (and sometimes even
creating) assignment questions. My work was used by more than forty students so
far, and it will most likely continue to be used for the same class for years to
come.

After helping create the course, I became a teaching apprentice, and helped
various students with their assignments. In this process, I have familiarized
myself with various technologies, such as:

- The Django framework (backend in python)
- React and React Native
- Deployment of backend through Heroku
- Deployment of frontend through Firebase
- Relational database manipulation using SQL Queries in PHP code
- Authentication of user using authentication tokens

In fact, this course taught me the basics I needed to start using React on
personal projects, such as eras.page!

Here are snippets of the content I have created for the course:
